[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Brazil is known for its iniquality in several aspects, such as in income, education, race, ethnicity, gender, age, among others. With that in mind, we want to investigate whether this social inequality is reflected in the results of the ENEM exam.\nExame Nacional do Ensino Médio (ENEM) is a non-mandatory, standardized Brazilian national exam, which evaluates high school students in Brazil. The ENEM is the most important exam of its kind in Brazil, with more than 8.6 million registered candidates in 2016. The exam is administrated by National Institute for Educational Studies and Research \u0026ldquo;Anísio Teixeira\u0026rdquo; (INEP), which provides each student results (anonimous, obviously) along with a social economic survey. In this work we analyse the performance of them and try to find some patters related to social aspects of the contestants.\nThis work is still under development and currently submitted to the XVI Regression Models School which will happen between March 24th and 27th in Pirenopolis, Brazil.\n","date":1547389185,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547389185,"objectID":"be3e25d71260ad009bf37865f250c3d5","permalink":"https://magnotairone.github.io/project/enem/","publishdate":"2019-01-13T12:19:45-02:00","relpermalink":"/project/enem/","section":"project","summary":"This is the project I am currently working on.

From a technical perspective, setting the model and the prior distributions are the simplest part of the process. What makes it difficult is the computation of the posterior full conditionals and the implementation of the Gibbs Sampler algorithm. The BUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) family of statistical softwares reduces the effort of modeling, since the user must indicate only the prior distributions and the likelihood function. However, in general these softwares do not implement several spatial models, although users of WinBUGS and OpenBUGS can enjoy from the spatial add-on called GeoBUGS. JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler), the open-source C++ developed version of the BUGS family, does not contain any function or distribution for spatial modeling. This project aims to fill this gap through the implementation of an extension to the JAGS software, allowing users from different fields to perform a spatial data modeling and analysis.\nYou can download the already available source code for Mac and Linux here. Instructions for installing can be found here along with an example of usage. Soon I will publish here an example on how to use GeoJAGS considering a real data set.\n","date":1547386334,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547386334,"objectID":"005e01036c2708cb44695890c2baf61b","permalink":"https://magnotairone.github.io/project/geojags/","publishdate":"2019-01-13T11:32:14-02:00","relpermalink":"/project/geojags/","section":"project","summary":"A module for JAGS containing several covariance functions for point-referenced data analysis and a function that creates the precision matrix for the proper CAR model for areal data analysis.
