      <title>Visualizing the inequalities in Brazil through the results of ENEM</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brazil is known for its iniquality in several aspects, such as in income, education, race, ethnicity, gender, age, among others. With that in mind, we want to investigate whether this social inequality is reflected in the results of the ENEM exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio (ENEM) is a non-mandatory, standardized Brazilian national exam, which evaluates high school students in Brazil.
The ENEM is the most important exam of its kind in Brazil, with more than 8.6 million registered candidates in 2016.
The exam is administrated by National Institute for Educational Studies and Research &amp;ldquo;Anísio Teixeira&amp;rdquo; (INEP), which provides each student results (anonimous, obviously) along with a social economic survey.
In this work we analyse the performance of them and try to find some patters related to social aspects of the contestants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is still under development and currently submitted to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.emr2019.com.br/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;XVI Regression Models School&lt;/a&gt; which will happen between March 24th and 27th in Pirenopolis, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bayesian hierarchical modeling for spatial data is challenging for professionals from other areas than statistics.
From a technical perspective, setting the model and the prior distributions are the simplest part of the process.
What makes it difficult is the computation of the posterior full conditionals and the implementation of the Gibbs Sampler algorithm.
The &lt;tt&gt;BUGS&lt;/tt&gt; (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) family of statistical softwares reduces the effort of modeling, since the user must indicate only the prior distributions and the likelihood function.
However, in general these softwares do not implement several spatial models, although users of &lt;tt&gt;WinBUGS&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;OpenBUGS&lt;/tt&gt; can enjoy from the spatial add-on called &lt;tt&gt;GeoBUGS&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;tt&gt;JAGS&lt;/tt&gt; (Just Another Gibbs Sampler), the open-source &lt;tt&gt;C++&lt;/tt&gt; developed version of the &lt;tt&gt;BUGS&lt;/tt&gt; family, does not contain any function or distribution for spatial modeling.
This project aims to fill this gap through the implementation of an extension to the &lt;tt&gt;JAGS&lt;/tt&gt; software, allowing users from different fields to perform a spatial data modeling and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the already available source code for Mac and Linux &lt;a href=&#34;https://geojags.sourceforge.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Instructions for installing can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourceforge.net/projects/geojags/files/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; along with an example of usage.
Soon I will publish here an example on how to use &lt;tt&gt;GeoJAGS&lt;/tt&gt; considering a real data set.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Veraz is a project of the Stats4good group, which is as team of graduate students that analyze data from the Brazilian federal government expenses. This is challenging since we deal with a great amout of data. We maintain a blog with our analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
