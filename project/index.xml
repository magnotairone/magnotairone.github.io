      <description>Brazil is known for its iniquality in several aspects, such as in income, education, race, ethnicity, gender, age, among others. With that in mind, we want to investigate whether this social inequality is reflected in the results of the ENEM exam.

      <description>Bayesian hierarchical modeling for spatial data is challenging for professionals from other areas than statistics. From a technical perspective, setting the model and the prior distributions are the simplest part of the process. What makes it difficult is the computation of the posterior full conditionals and the implementation of the Gibbs Sampler algorithm. The BUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) family of statistical softwares reduces the effort of modeling, since the user must indicate only the prior distributions and the likelihood function.</description>
